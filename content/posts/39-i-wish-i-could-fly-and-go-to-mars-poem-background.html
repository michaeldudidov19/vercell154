    <p><strong>39+ I Wish I Could Fly And Go To Mars Poem Background</strong>. I&#039;d sit there and watch as everyone crowded around down below to see what i was up too and i&#039;d listen to their faint voices asking questions like &#039;is he going to jump?&#039; Someday i wish i could fly, soar through the freeways of the sky.</p>

                The rhythmic poems are short but why do key holes have no keys why do fairies have no tales can i dial the numbers please which is why do grannies dress in lace why must children go to bed am i in the human race is my mind in my. I wish i could fly around and around over this town the dirt on the ground i&#039;d follow your course of doors left ajar to try to find out who you really are who you really are. I wish i could fly poem by arti chopra.

    <h3>It seemed to mean so little, meant so much more about this poem.</h3>
    <p>Halfway through the night i wake up in a dream echoes in my head make every whisper turn into a scream. Little things tiny wings i wish i could fly. I let it come and go. I&#039;d sit there and watch as everyone crowded around down below to see what i was up too and i&#039;d listen to their faint voices asking questions like &#039;is he going to jump?&#039;</p>
