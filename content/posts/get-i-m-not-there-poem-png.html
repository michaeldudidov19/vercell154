    <p><strong>Get I M Not There Poem PNG</strong>. I can put on an act and pretend that i&#039;m tough but deep down i never quite feel brave enough sometimes i feel so small in this big big world that i feel like all i have are my words to keep my sense of control these poems, they&#039;re like my therapy you know, a place where i can release and. Do not stand at my grave and weep</p>
