                &#039;the poem of mine usually cited for violence is hawk roosting, this ted hughes first published hawk roosting in 1960 in the book lupercal and it has been a popular poem how does the personification change the way we think about this raptor, master of its own world, top. He soon started writing poetry and produced his first poem at the age of fifteen. Something else is alive beside the clock&#039;s loneliness and this blank page however, the problem with hughes is that out of his ~1000 or so poems, i&#039;d say not more than ~250 are worth reading even once, and maybe 50.

    <p>Ted hughes &gt;ted hughes (born 1930) was an eminent english poet who led a resurgence of &gt;english poetic innovation starting in the late 1950s. Hughes did not steadily improve, nor steadily decline in quality. Edward james hughes, famously known as ted hughes, was an intelligent child of william henry and edith hughes.
