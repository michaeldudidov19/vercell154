                I want to go up to them and say stop, don&#039;t do itâ€”she&#039;s the wrong woman, he&#039;s the wrong man, you are going to do.

    <p>Olds&#039; brash style ensures that her message is clearly delivered but her original and sometimes unexpected use of imagery keeps that delivery fresh and entertaining. This poem has more meaning than you give it, for the imagery and foreshadowing it is filled with. I see them standing at the formal gates of their colleges, i see my father strolling out. The poem&#039;s direct title hints at its strident subject matter.</p>
