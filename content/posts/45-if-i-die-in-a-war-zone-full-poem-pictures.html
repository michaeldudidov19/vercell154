    <p>This war story is if i die tim o&#039;brien&#039;s war story could have been me. He explains what it was like to be drafted into the war and the hardships that he went through fighting the vietcong. The author takes us with him to experience combat from behind an infantryman&#039;s rifle, to walk the minefields of my lai, to crawl into the ghostly tunnels, and to explore the ambiguities of manhood and morality in a war gone terribly wrong. A genuine memoir in the full literary sense of that term, and a work that quickly established itself among vietnam narratives as an o&#039;brien writes with pain and passion on the nature of war and its effect on the men who fight in it.</p>
