    <h3>I have a dream too poem by jackie compton.</h3>
    <p>I have a dream, too but must walk across the stage, but in order to do that, i must leave this day and age. Hughes drives this point home in his poem i, too, that shows how people in america still do not see all life as equal. I have a dream is a public speech that was delivered by american civil rights activist martin luther king jr. Some that i had not known were dead.</p>
