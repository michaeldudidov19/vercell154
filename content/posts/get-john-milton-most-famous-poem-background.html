                Paradise lost, his epic work published in milton was plagued in his later years by failing eyesight and many of his poems were dictated to assistants, one of whom was the poet andrew marvell. Methought i saw my late espoused saint brought to me like alcestis from the grave, whom jove&#039;s great son to her glad husband gave, rescued from death by john milton. In his prose works he advocated the abolition of the church of england.
